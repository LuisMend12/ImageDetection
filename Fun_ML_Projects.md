Monte Carlo Simulation
This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation implementation to solve various types of problems using stochastic processes. Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for performing numerical simulations and solving complex mathematical problems by relying on random sampling.

Overview
The Monte Carlo simulation in this repository demonstrates how randomness can be used to approximate solutions to problems in areas such as probability, integration, optimization, and physics. The project includes implementations of Monte Carlo simulations for several use cases:

Estimating Pi: Using random sampling to approximate the value of π.

Simulating Random Walks: Modeling random movements to study systems such as particles or stocks.

Integration Approximation: Estimating the value of integrals using random points.

Optimization Problems: Applying Monte Carlo methods to optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Features
Modular design: The simulation includes various modules for different use cases.

Customizable parameters: Users can adjust the number of samples, precision, and the range of simulations.

Visualization: Some of the simulation results are visualized using Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn (if applicable).

Command-line interface (CLI): Easily run simulations from the command line with custom parameters.
